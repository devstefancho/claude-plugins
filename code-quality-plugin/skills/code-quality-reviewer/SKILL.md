# Code Quality Reviewer

## Overview

This skill provides systematic code quality review focusing on three core principles that determine maintainability, readability, and long-term sustainability of code:

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminate code duplication and consolidate common logic
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Prefer simple, straightforward solutions over complex ones
- **CLEAN CODE (Easy to Read)**: Write self-documenting code that's easy to understand

The skill applies to all code changes: features, bug fixes, refactoring, and chores.

## Review Process

### Step 1: Gather Code Context
- Read the modified files to understand the changes
- Search for related code patterns in the codebase
- Identify the scope and impact of the changes

### Step 2: Analyze Code Quality
- Check for code duplication (DRY principle)
- Evaluate code complexity and simplicity (KISS principle)
- Assess readability and clarity (CLEAN CODE principle)

### Step 3: Identify Issues
- Document specific violations with file paths and line numbers
- Categorize issues by severity and principle
- Suggest concrete improvements

### Step 4: Provide Recommendations
- Include refactored code examples where applicable
- Explain the benefits of the proposed changes
- Link to related principles for context

## Quality Review Checklist

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- [ ] Check for duplicated logic across functions/methods
- [ ] Look for repeated code patterns in similar components
- [ ] Identify common operations that could be extracted to utilities
- [ ] Verify helper functions are reused appropriately
- [ ] Check for duplicate error handling patterns
- [ ] Identify repeated conditional logic

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
- [ ] Evaluate function complexity (line count, nested levels)
- [ ] Check for overly complex conditional logic
- [ ] Identify unnecessary abstraction layers
- [ ] Review parameter lists for excessive arguments
- [ ] Check for over-engineered solutions
- [ ] Verify the simplest solution is being used

### CLEAN CODE (Easy to Read)
- [ ] Verify meaningful variable and function names
- [ ] Check function/method documentation and comments
- [ ] Evaluate consistent code formatting and style
- [ ] Review logical code organization and flow
- [ ] Check for self-documenting code (clear intent)
- [ ] Identify cryptic or magic values that need explanation

## When This Skill Activates

This skill is automatically invoked when you:
- Ask for code review or quality assessment
- Request feedback on code changes
- Ask about code maintainability or readability
- Request refactoring suggestions
- Question code complexity or duplication
- Review pull requests or commits
- Work on code cleanup or optimization

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Reviewing Feature Code
```
"Can you review this new user authentication module for code quality?"
â†’ Skill reviews for DRY principles (reusing auth logic), KISS simplicity,
  and CLEAN CODE readability
```

### Scenario 2: Bug Fix Assessment
```
"I fixed this performance issue. Is the code quality acceptable?"
â†’ Skill checks if the fix is simple, well-documented, and doesn't
  introduce duplication
```

### Scenario 3: Refactoring Validation
```
"I'm thinking about refactoring this helper function. Any concerns?"
â†’ Skill analyzes if current code violates any principles and validates
  refactoring approach
```

## Key Differences from Style Review

Unlike style review (formatting, naming conventions), quality review focuses on:
- **Logical structure and maintainability**
- **Code duplication and reusability**
- **Complexity assessment**
- **Readability of implementation patterns**

A style reviewer checks if code follows conventions; a quality reviewer checks if code is maintainable.
